Week 1:

Calibration (sensor reading)
In order to calibrate the phototransistor, we took sample data with different darkness lines.
Each transistor outputs values that corresponds to the amount of IR light that the sensors recieves.
  - Darker-colored prints should output higher values while whiter colors should be lower. 
While shfting the sample "path" from one end to another, we took 9 readings, spaning from -4 to +4cm, for 5 ticks each and recorded each values on a google sheet. 

Google Sheet
We took the average of 5 readings for each sensors, so that we have 9 lines of samples in total.
We then found the minimum value of each sensor and subtracted them from the readings for each sensor. 
  e.g.) If the minimum value of sensor 1 was x, subtract x from all sensor readings for sensor 1. 
Normalized all sensor readings using equation f(x) = x*10/max, where max is the max value after subtracting minimum value

Test #1

  - Observation: After placing the car on the track, we had to manually position it so that it detected the black line. The car started doing donuts after starting and continued.
    * The left wheel was moving forward while the right wheel was going backward. 
    * The speed of each wheel differed, even when the wheel was placed in the middle of the track.

Code adjustment: The pinMode definition of the right wheel was wrong. The direction pin should have been initialized to LOW but was set to HIGH. 

Observation: The car followed the track all the way while the line was straight. The car
