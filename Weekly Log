Week 1:

Calibration (sensor reading)
In order to calibrate the phototransistor, we took sample data with different darkness lines.
Each transistor outputs values that corresponds to the amount of IR light that the sensors recieves.
  - Darker-colored prints should output higher values while whiter colors should be lower. 
While shfting the sample "path" from one end to another, we took 9 readings, spaning from -4 to +4cm, for 5 ticks each and recorded each values on a google sheet. 

Google Sheet
We took the average of 5 readings for each sensors, so that we have 9 lines of samples in total.
We then found the minimum value of each sensor and subtracted them from the readings for each sensor. 
  e.g.) If the minimum value of sensor 1 was x, subtract x from all sensor readings for sensor 1. 
Normalized all sensor readings using equation f(x) = x*10/max, where max is the max value after subtracting minimum value
